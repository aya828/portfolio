              I was born in New Jersey and raised both in NJ and Tokyo, Japan. I
              studied Journalism for my undergrad at Brooklyn College and earned
              a Bachelorâ€™s degree. I began working retail at Apple then
              transitioned into technical support at Apple, where my interest
              grew for technology. I am currently pursuing my Master's Degree in
              Cybersecurity at Marymount University in Arlington.

              While working as a Systems Administrator, in both the private sector and on Capitol Hill, I gained an interest in software development. I completed the George Washington
              University Full Stack Web Development Coding Bootcamp and am now pursuing my career in web development.
