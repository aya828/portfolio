              I was born in New Jersey and raised both in NJ and Tokyo, Japan. I studied Journalism for undergrad
              at Brooklyn College and earned a Bachelorâ€™s degree. I then started working retail at Apple then
              transitioned into technical support at Apple, where my interest grew for technology.

              I became a Systems Administrator and soon found that a Systems Administrator
              was not something I wanted to be. I found the GWU Coding Bootcamp online and decided to take this
              step towards becoming a web developer!
