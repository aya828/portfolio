              I was born in New Jersey and raised both in NJ and Tokyo, Japan. I studied Journalism for my undergrad
              at Brooklyn College and earned a Bachelorâ€™s degree. I then started working retail at Apple then
              transitioned into technical support at Apple, where my interest grew for technology.

              I became a Systems Administrator and became more interested in learning about software development. I found the George Washington University Full Stack Web Development Coding Bootcamp online and decided to take this
              step towards becoming a web developer!
